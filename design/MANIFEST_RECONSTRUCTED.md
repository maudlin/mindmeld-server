# Reconstruction Manifest (To-Be First)

Created design/to-be/ as the primary architectural plan. Current repo contents are secondary and may be discarded.

To-Be (authoritative drafts)
- design/to-be/README.md
- design/to-be/MVP_PLAN.md (verbatim from discussion)
- design/to-be/API.md
- design/to-be/DATABASE.md
- design/to-be/DEPLOYMENT.md
- design/to-be/MERGE-STRATEGY.md
- design/to-be/adr/0001-mvp-architecture.md

Next
- Review and amend ADR 0001.
- Decide Express vs Fastify.
- If approved, I will scaffold code under a new module namespace for /maps + SQLite, leaving existing code untouched until you confirm removal.
